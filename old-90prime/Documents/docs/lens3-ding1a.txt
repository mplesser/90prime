here's what i'm finding in old email

3 May 2000
I stoned out the chingus on the flat side of lens 3 also.  It's ugly but
it's small.

Below is from Jim Burge April 3 2000
Ed,

The flat surface on lens 3 was damaged in processing.  There is a 1/8 inch
ding in the surface about 1.8 inches from the edge.  I see 3 options:

1.  Start over.  The substrate cost around $2k.  There are a couple weeks
work getting the lens to where it is now.  Both surfaces polished, but final
figuring not complete.

2.  Live with it.  The thing could be ground out to about 3 mm diameter.
The beam for a single field point is 88 mm in diameter.  The clear aperture
for the lens is 240 mm.  The ding would act like a bubble, scattering light
out of 0.22% of the light out of any image that falls on it.  It would be
completely out of focus in the detector plane, but it could reduce contrast
across the field if a bright star hits it.  It could be painted black to
minimize this.
Unless you need photometric quality better than 1%, I recommend that we
simply grind this out and paint it black.

3.  Reduce the thickness of the optic by enough to grind through this.  The
edge thickness of the 260 mm diameter lens is already only 12 mm.  We would
have to reduce it by 2-3 mm, which gets pretty small.  Warren could look at
the deflections of the lens.

Either option 1 or option 2 seems OK to me.
I wouldn't thin the lens more.

Ed-

My opinion is to live with it and paint it black.
