We acid etched the edge and back to relieve stress in the blank because =
I was concerned at the change in figure measured by Lee before =
Thanksgiving.  We have begun re-grinding the spherical surface. =20

We have chipped the spherical surface in the process of measuring the =
wedge.  It is a small chip coming in from the edge, but it does extend =
into the clear aperture a little.  I'll get Jim to look at it but I =
think it will be OK. =20

We will proceed with polishing the rear.  THen measure the figure and =
axis centration again.
