Here is a brief explanation of the basic effects of small dings...

The 2 mm ding is tiny compared with the 200 mm beam from a single star.  For
each star, the ding does 2 bad things:
1. Scatters light out of the image making it dimmer by an amount 
	2(Ading/Abeam)^2 = 0.02%.  This loss will be present for all of the
stars, and it is so tiny you will never see this effect.

2.  Half of his light is absorbed, the other half is scattered.  So each
star will spread 0.01% of its light all over angles roughly lambda/Dding.  1
mrad.  the place.  This increases your background slightly.  The lens is
roughly 700 mm from the focal plane, so each star will have a ghost halo,
about 175 um wide with 0.01% of the light in it.  0.5 arcsec images, the
images are 17 um.  The ghost will be about 0.0001% as bright as its star.
You will not be able to see it unless your detector has dynamic range of
1000000:1 or 20 bits.

For 1 arcsec images, this ratio is of course 4 times worse 18 bits.

Where these can hurt you most is obviously for very high contrast
observations.  

I hope this helps.
