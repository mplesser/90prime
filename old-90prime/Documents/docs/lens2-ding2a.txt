This morning it was reported that  we suffered additional damage on the =
L2 spherical surface.  This time it was Dean and he pinged the surface =
with the drive pin while adjusting it for a polishing run.  It is a =
small (~1mm diam) on the surface near the center.  It has also a typical =
conical fracture that extends into the depth of the glass probably more =
than a mm but is difficult to quantify since the fracture edge is not =
easily seen. =20
Jim was over here this morning and he and I examined it closely.  Jim's =
opinion is that the defect itself is small enough to ignore.  Typically, =
we would grind out the fracture as we did for L3 but I am reluctant to =
carve a hole in the surface  since it will increase the size of the =
unusable area.  We were concerned over the possibility that the fracture =
may propagate so we looked at it under crossed polarizers and can detect =
virtually no stress birefringence.  So it is unlikely that the fracture =
will propagate.  However, if the coating temperature is very high it may =
make the fracture move.=20
Jim suggested I speak with the coating vendor to determine what the =
optic will be subjected to in coating so I would like the contact =
information for the coater from you along with some way to identify the =
coating to the vendor so he knows which one I'm talking about.

We are pretty sure the spherical surface is finished otherwise, but Jim =
is checking the measured radius now.  Today, we are making a measurement =
of the asphere.
