Mike- this is an example of what I once sent the Barr, CustomSci, and one other place.
People who want to order new filters need this.


> We request bids on the following filters.
> We divide them into three sets: UBVRI, Washington, and SDSS
> 
> If there is a price difference in buying all 13 filters or a subset
> of those 13, please note.
> 
> If any of our specs is driving the price, please specify a relaxed
> parameter and lower price, as well as the price with our original specs.
> 
> 
> ALL FILTERS ARE TO BE PADDED TO 12mm THICKNESS USING CLEAR GLASS THAT
> DOES NOT MODIFY THE PASSBAND (probably BK7 except for UV filters)
> 
>  Common Specifications:
>   1. Standard Bessell Filters, Washington Filters, SDSS filters. If there
>      is any ambiguity in your minds, please contact us. See notes below.
> 
>      We also ask for a quotation for a non-standard I filter that is an
>      interference filter, as well. (This has slightly different CWL
>      from the Bessell I filter)
> 
>   2.  CWL and FWHM are specified for f/3.5 converging beam at 5 degrees C.
>   3.  Passband ripple is minimized for interference filters
>   4.  Transmission uniformities are less than 5%.
>   5.  Blocking 300-1200 nm:  no leaks worse than 0.01%.
>   6.  No pinholes per MIL-C-13830A.
>   7.  Size:  6.0 +0.0 -0.03 inches SQUARE, clear aperture 5.75 inches.
>   8.  Thickness:  12.0 mm +-  xxx (all filters to be padded to this thickness) [there was a mistake in this email and i haven't found the correct thickness tolerance yet]
>   10.  Parallelism:  1 arc minute or better.
>   11.  60-40 scratch-dig.
>   12.  A/R coat both sides, reflectivity less than 1.0% per surface.
>   13. For Interference Filters, 90% bandwidth shall be greater than 65% of FWHM.
> 
> We are concerned about redleaks on all filters and about peak throughput.
> Please quote peak throughput on each filter. It is best to quote
> empirical values, but theoretical values are acceptable if you have not made
> the specific filter before.
> I) UBVRI "Bessell Filters"
> U and B and V and R are all glass.
> We suggest that U be made with 1mm UG1, 1mm S8612, 2mm WG305.
> Please state a cost for this formula and for your formula. 
> We are very concerned about throughput for this filter.
> Redleak for this filter is a major concern.
> 
> Prescriptions for the remaining filters are as follows.
> If your prescription differs, please note in your bid (we are not wedded
> to the following prescriptions):
> 
> B  substrate BK7, 1mm GG385, 2mm BG39, 1mm BK12 external
> 
> V BK7 substrate, 2mm BG39, 2mm GG495 external
> 
> R BK7 subtrate, 2mm OG570, 2mm KG3 external
> 
> I BK7 substrate, 3mm RG9, 2mmWG305
> 
> The "Bessell I" filter is all glass. Please quote for this filter
> or for an interference filter matching the following passband:
> CWL=8035 Angstroms; fwhm= 1600 Angstroms
> the filter we own has almost a square wave throughput, so fwhm and
> fw90% are almost identical. Peak transmission is >90% and is greater
> than 75% across entire passband.
> 
> II Washington:
> 
> 1)  prescription for Washington C has changed:
> 3mm BG3 plus 4mm Bg 40 plus UBK7 to padd to 12mm
> 
> 2) Washington M:
> 3mm GG455
> 3mm S8612
> BK7 to padd to 12mm
> 
> 3) DDO51:
> interference filter
> CWL 514nm+-2nm
> Full band at half transmission 16nm+-3nm
> 90% bandwidth greater than 65% of FWHM
> minimum peak transmission 75%
> transmission peak variation in any area <5% absolute
> 
> 4) final Washington filter is actually SDSS i'
> interference filter
> 
> 4mm RG695
> BK 7 to pad to 12mm
> coating
>         T(680-832 nm)               > 94% (average)
>         T(900-1100 nm)              < 0.1%
>         cutoff (T=50%) wavelength   850 +- 5 nm         
>         cutoff width                < 20 nm
>         amp. of ripples             < 5%
>       anti-reflection coating on the other side 
>                   R<1% over the bandpass range
> 
> III) SDSS filters
> Note that we would already be purchasing SDSS i' above
> So we'd like SDSS u' g' r' z'
