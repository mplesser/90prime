Some quick facts

On each CCD, East is up and North is right. So if you need to move your object
left, move it north. Pixel scale is about 0.45 arcsec/pixel.

ccd3     ccd4

ccd1     ccd2


CCD3 has a trap about 2/3 of the way up, about in the middle. Data above
the trap are useless.

CCD1 has some weird pixels in upper left.

CCDs 3 and 4 have 1 or two bad columns.

There may be other features to be described later.

As of 3pm on 7Apr04, the best focus for CCD2 isn't the same as for the
other CCDs. You may have to ignore the existence of CCD2 for a while,
unfortunately. We'll let you know if we can fix focus by
tilting the dewar relative to the optics (we do this with
the focus actuators, fyi).


Since there's a substantial gutter between ccds, roughly 1000 pixels,
you'll likely want to zero your coords somewhere other than the
unseen center of the array. You might want to put it on
the center of some chip. That said, note that offsetting
by TCS keyboard commands wants offsets in hms and dms. If you
paddle over, you can read off the offsets in arcsec,

The full well of the CCDs is low, about 70k electrons, or about 35k
ADU. The last measured values are:
Amp 1: 1.78 e/DN
Amp 2: 1.81 e/DN
Amp 3: 1.68 e/DN
Amp 4: 1.67 e/DN
Amp 5: 1.71 e/DN
Amp 6: 1.72 e/DN
Amp 7: 1.62 e/DN
Amp 8: 1.71 e/DN

90prime gui (on the linux box STJUKSHON) startup/usage instructions


1) There is a set of mounting and testing instructions that
   in principle exists. So this manual starts from the
   successful mounting of the instrument.

2) Filters- Only Gary Rosenbaum is authorized to put filters
   into filter holders. I reiterate, the only person to touch
   raw glass is Gary Rosenbaum. the only person to clean filters
   is Gary Rosenbaum. The only person to remove filters from
   filter holders is Gary rosenbaum.

   Got it? Only Gary Rosenbaum will handle filters. Plan ahead.

   We now have a whole bunch of 6" holders, into which the existing
   90prime-owned filters will be permanently mounted. We need to
   make a holder-box for the filters-plus-holders. 

   Once filters are permanently mounted, Bill Wood will be allowed
   to remove holders from the instrument and install new ones.
   Things should be relatively safe once filters are permanently
   mounted. Observers CANNOT add/remove filters from the
   instrument even after they're mounted in holders.

3) Nitrogen filling- The operator will fill the dewar once per day.
   Hold time is longer than 2 nights, but the change in weight
   as nitrogen boils off will unbalance the telescope if it
   isn't filled daily.

4) Starting the 90prime Instrument gui and running the gui

      Double click on the icon "90prime Instrument GUI"
      The control interface will come up running (in older versions
      you had to make it run).

      You'll see a bunch of lights and 4 tabs- Focus, Filter Wheel,
      Guide Camera, and Misc.

      For now, you need to type the follwoing command into a xterm
      window, "dataserver". This command now works as of 7Apr04, but
      apparently one can go back to the old way if it fails. It
      will require a phonecall to go back to the old way.
      This command sets up the way we transfer data from the CCD computer
      (running WINDOWS) to STJUKSHON (this computer, running LINUX).
      It also sets up a DS9 display for quick look. You'll
      want to use "mscdisplay" for real analysis like "imexamine".


      We'll now quickly go through the tabs:

       THE FOCUS TAB

         On startup, you'll see three LVDT readings, one for each
         focus actuator. Usually you'll see the last digit change
         by one. That's insurance that things are actually running.
         The LVDTs give an absolute reference frame.

         Now we'll explain the buttons one by one:
        
       a)  Focus- this actively moves the three focus actuators
          a predefined amount. the predefined amount is set by typing
          a number of encoder steps (as opposed to LVDT increments)
          into the steps windows. If the "link" button is on, you only
          type into B, and that same number appears in A and C.
          That's the mode you'll use.

          Do hit a carriage return.

          The gui also converts encoder steps into microns, and keeps
          track of total steps.

          Actual focussing is done using the CCD control software.
          The software will take an exposure, close the shutter,
          shift charge, change the focus, opern the shutter, etc,
          and then finally readout. 

          We have aligned the focal plane of the CCDs as best we can with
          the focal plane of the optics. If you move actuators A B C
          different amounts, you've destroyed this work.

          For reference, in January 2004, good focus was A=2.237, B=2.217,
          C=2.309. While the value will change (It should go down xxx
          as the temperature goes up), the offsets between the three actuators
          should not change. So check that these offsets are about right,
          and if they aren't, you should look for a note or you should make
          a phonecall to see if there was an update or if the previous
          observer screwed up.

          You can keep track of the focus by clicking on the button
          SET REFERENCES.

       b) SET REFERENCES
    
          We jsut discussed it above.

       c) TWEAK FOCUS

          The instrument flexes. That's bad. The LVDTs allow us to
          monitor that flexure. TWEAK FOCUS unflexes the telescope by
          driving the LVDTs back to their reference values. So after
          a focus run, do click on SET REFERENCES.

          To reiterate, you've just gotten into perfect focus. We'd
          like to believe that if you move to somewhere else in the sky,
          all that changes is because of instrument flexure. To first
          order, we can remove that change by hitting TWEAK FOCUS.
          Of course, the telescope itself flexes too, and perhaps
          the optics assembly itself flexes. At this point, we are
          pretty convinced that most problems you'll encounter
          will be fixed by TWEAK FOCUS and/or a focus run.

          DO NOT change individual actuators. It's currently
          a real pain to align the focal plane. If you want to
          help us write software to align the focal plane quickly,
          we'd be grateful for your help.

       d) ZERO TOTALS

          It zeros out the totals windows.

       e) ZERO ENCODERS

          It zeros the encoder windows. 
 

       THE FILTER WHEEL TAB

       Since this part of the gui was written, our way of intereacting
       with it has been modified to make it better.
   
       So ,let's start by clicking on CONTROL. 
       That will bring up a popup that you'll leave running at all times.
       So move the popup to a favorite place.

       Many of the commands in the main tab are repeated in the popup.
       Ignore the ones in the main tab, use the popup.

       Therefore, aside from some reassuring lights, here is a list
       of the only buttons you'll push in the main FILTER WHEEL tab:
        CONTROL (we've already talked about the fact that it brings
         up a super useful popup)
        POPULATE WINDOW - this allows Gary Rosenbaum to put filters
         into the instrument.
        ROTATION OFF (and ON)- this might be used in an emergency, as
         would be explained to you by one of us.

       So, the rest of this section will explain the "90prime Filter
        Wheel Control" popup:

        INIT FILTER WHEEL- this is done right after Gary Rosenbaum
         loads filters, or after a power failure. Basically, the filter wheel
         is spun around once, stopping momentarily to read the tabs
         in each filter holder. The computer then knows the filter
         number in each filter position (filter number refers to the filter
         holder whereas filter position is one of six slots in the filter
         wheel).

        READ FILTERS- There's a file on this computer, at
         /home/bokobs/90prime/galil/filters.txt
         that contains the transformation between filter position
         and filter name. This file is edited by the Gary Rosenbaum.
         Hitting READ FILTERS applies this program. Now
         you know the real names of your filters.

        CHANGE FILTERS- This changes from the current filter to the 
         filter that is selected in the Filter Names box.

        SLIDE- our filter wheel works by rotating into position, then
         sliding the filter in. So rather than using the CHANGE FILTERS
         button we could ROTATE and then SLIDE.  The SLIDE direction is
         controlled with an in/out toggle. When a filter
         is in the beam, the ROTATE button is disabled so
         that you can't rotate with a filter in the beam.

        now ROTATE- assuming you have no filter in the beam,
         you can set the filter name in the window, and then hit
         ROTATE to rotate to that location.

        CLOSE closes this popup

        STOP RUNNING 
        You'll almost never be instructed to push this button



    THE GUIDE CAMERA TAB

      Focussing is now done at the TCS console by the operator.
      You'll have to INITIALIZE and CHANGE guide FILTER (guide filter
       is different from science filter, guider light is picked
       off before science filter)

      We've provided a few 1" round filters for now in the guider:
        1) blank/clear
        2) RED
        3) neutral density
        4) blank
        5) green
        6) blue

      We don't have much experience for how much guiding with the
      'correct filter' matters.


     The guide camera is at a fixed location. It's fed by a pickoff
     mirror. If you don't have guide stars, your only choices are
     to increase the guider exposure time or to move the telescope a bit.
     The guider field is roughly 4x4 arcmin. The telescope field is roughly
     60x60 arcmin, with roughly 10 arcmin gutters between CCDs.

     From pixel (3993,3868), roughly, on CCD1 (lower left CCD in
     the mosaic), one offsets 328 arcsec WEST and 3123 arcsec NORTH
     to center that star on the guider. This is just a useful
     fact.


     MISC.

     At this point, these are potential commands that'll only
     be used by you at Grant's command.


____________________________________________________________________________

     The CCD (on rack mounted BOKCCD2) computer

     This is a machine running WINDOWS. It talks to the CCD
     controller. While it is in principle a stand-alone
     machine, we use it to run the data-taking gui and to
     ship data to STJUKSHON.

     Mike Lesser has a prototype version of the LABVIEW executable
     (LABVIEW is what makes the guis for us) that will run in linux,
     thus allowing the gui to appear on stjukshon, thus making
     it easier for one person to observe. This version is not totally
     tested. We'll let you know when it appears.



     If you turn the machine or or reboot it, the 90PrimeAzCamServer
     will come up automatically. Yuo can minimize it.

     Then double click on AzCamTool icon in upper right. It'll
     load a bunch of stuff and be running. This is what you need
     to take data.

     You'll need to set some parameters (ps: there's a longer version
     on the 90prime site at compton.as.arizona.edu/90prime)

     1) Click on Detector. It'll say 4096x4096, binned 1x1, with 40 cols
        of overscan per ccd. You'll not have to change this, so
        hit cancel (clearly if you do make changes, hit 'apply")

     2) RESET button resets the controller. It might sometime be
        needed.

     3) PREFERENCES has a bunch of flags. The only one you might
        want to check that's not already checked is "Prompt
        for Image Title"

     4) click on FILENAME button.
        Here's where you set where on STJUKSHON the data will end up.
        You'll also control rootnames and sequence numbers and several
        automatic aspects of naming here.

     5) Save Image should always be on

     6) You can type into anything yellow. Be careful not to mess with
        binning, you could waste a lot of time if you change that
        and forget.

     7) there's a MODE information window:
        you'll see IDLE, PREPARING, EXPOSING, READOUT, CREATING.
        The last one means that the readout stream is being properly
         assembled and shipped.

     8) There are many other features: Imagetype, expose/pause,
        sequence, testimage, title, exposure time. With luck these
        will quickly be self evident.

     9) Lots of other abilities I haven't described (for instance
        RUN SCRIPT), partly because these abilities are new
        and/or not completely tested, or because edo doesn't
        yet know how they work.

Archiving data

The DDS4 dat drive is called /dev/nst0, or /dev/nst0m for compressed.
If you already have compressed data, this compression will
buy you little/nothing. 

There's a dvd reader/writer. You can use DVDRECORD or XCDROAST.
Neil Lauver is the only one we know who's successfully written
DVDs. We'll add more later.

There's also scp to downtown or to your laptop.

There's also a USB option, plug it in. The mountpoint is
/mnt/diskonkey
so say cp *.fits.gz .
or some such command, but you know that.

STEWARD MAKES NO AUTOMATIC ARCHIVES OF ANY SORT. IT'S UP TO YOU.
[we have chatted with noao about becoming part of their
automatic archive, but this is far from coming to pass.]

Flatfields, fringing and the like

When we conceived of 90prime, we assumed flats would be twilight
or dark sky flats. We are slowly trying to make working dome flats
since the weather often won't cooperate.

Note that the operators work from 0.5 hours after sunset to
0.5 hours before sunrise. This is not ideal for flats. 
With other instruments, the observer makes a deal with
the operator to come early and go home early. If taking only
eveing flats, say, is insufficient, write a polite note
in the trouble report. Bob Peterson and Paul Smith and
Bill Wood are aware that some changes may need to be made.
Exactly what those changes could be is unclear.

As of April 7, 2004, the flatfield lamps are still uneven
with specular reflections. My guess is that right now they're
not useful. We're working SLOWLY on the problem.

There are fringes in the redder passbands. You need to take
the proper data to make fringe frames. We'll see if we can
make a library of fringe frames.
