Steve,  Ed,
 
The radius of the L2 sphere is within spec.  I calculate 1128.2 +/- 0.1 mm.
The spec is 1128.1 +/- 1 mm.
It is not clear whether the surface is polished out.  I didn't inspect this.
If it is polished out then it is done.
 
The ding in the lens will cost the system a 2 mm obscuration.  The beam
diameter here is 200 mm, so we lose 1/10000 of the area.  The ding  will
need to be painted out.  Unless there is a compelling reason to do anything
else, I think we should leave it and not try to excise it.  There is no
visible stress around the fracture.  The only concern is during coating.
Steve should talk to the coater.
 
Jim

Ed, 
 
This morning it was reported that  we suffered additional damage on the L2
spherical surface.  This time it was Dean and he pinged the surface with the
drive pin while adjusting it for a polishing run.  It is a small (~1mm diam)
on the surface near the center.  It has also a typical conical fracture that
extends into the depth of the glass probably more than a mm but is difficult
to quantify since the fracture edge is not easily seen.  
Jim was over here this morning and he and I examined it closely.  Jim's
opinion is that the defect itself is small enough to ignore.  Typically, we
would grind out the fracture as we did for L3 but I am reluctant to carve a
hole in the surface  since it will increase the size of the unusable area.
We were concerned over the possibility that the fracture may propagate so we
looked at it under crossed polarizers and can detect virtually no stress
birefringence.  So it is unlikely that the fracture will propagate.
However, if the coating temperature is very high it may make the fracture
move. 
Jim suggested I speak with the coating vendor to determine what the optic
will be subjected to in coating so I would like the contact information for
the coater from you along with some way to identify the coating to the
vendor so he knows which one I'm talking about.
 
We are pretty sure the spherical surface is finished otherwise, but Jim is
checking the measured radius now.  Today, we are making a measurement of the
asphere.
