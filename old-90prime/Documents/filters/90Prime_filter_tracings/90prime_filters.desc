   The attached tarfile contains ASCII and postscript versions of the 90prime
spectral response functions for the 5 broadband filters, UBVRI, and 3 other
filters (SDSS u and z, and Washington M) for which the manufacturer had sent
electronic version of the filter trace.  They're intended to be
self-explanatory, so please let me know where I failed to do that and I'll fix
'em.  Thanks.
