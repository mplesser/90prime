Ed,

I have evaluated the chip in L2 and recommend that we proceed with the part,
then paint the area black before installing the lens.
The chip is big and ugly, but the area it extends into the clear aperture is
only about 8 mm across.  The beam is 200 mm across here, so worst case, it
affects 0.16%.  
In fact, we can do much better then this.  If we clock the chip so that it
is oriented along the sides (not the corners) of the filters and the CCD,
then it will never be seen by the focal plane.  We do need to make sure that
we do NOT put it on the side of the guider.

Steve is proceeding with the spherical surface, assuming that he does not
need to correct it.  The option for fixing the lens would be to regenerate
the surface.  We would lose about 1 mm of thickness and several days.  Since
we can simply orient the part to make the problem go away, I recommend we
accept the part with the ding in it.

If you have questions, please call me.  Otherwise, please give Steve the
okay to finish the lens as is.

Jim
