- Turn the power ON to the CCD guider controller power supply (on the
  telescope).

- Double click "Telcom Server" to start the telescope communication
server.  This might already be running, move the mouse to the bottom
of the screen to check.  If it starts with an error use
Control-Alt-Delete to kill wishXXX.

- Click the "Start server" on the "Telcom Server" window to start
commincations with TCS.  You may now minimize the "Telcom Server"
window.

- Double click "AzCamServer" to start the guider controller software.
The last line in the window should be "Now listening to client
connections....".  If an error occurs check the guider power and the
fiber optic cables.  A green LED should be visible on the fiber optic
interface card on the back of this computer (bokpc3).  You may now
minimize the AzCamServer window.

- Double click "90PrimeGuider" or "90CassGuider" to start the guider
program.  Typically you should use the saved paramaters option to
start with previously working guide paramaters.

- Shutdown in reverse order.  Kill the Telcom Server with the "x" in
  the top right corner.

TROUBLESHOOTING

- If telcom server does not start and complains that a socket is in
use, use Control-Alt-Delete to kill the task "wishxx" using End Task,
wait 15 seconds, then try again.

- If the guider won't shut down, use Control-Alt-Delete to kill the
Autoguider program.  You may have to make sure a dialog box is not
open, and wait 15 seconds for the program to be killed (a pop-up will
appear to confirm).
