The following is an example of how to read and use the 90prime Galil
routines API.

In this example consider the routine #FILTMOV.  The API entry for
this routine is given as:

******************************************************************

-----------------------------------------------------
#FILTMOV
-----------------------------------------------------
                                                                                
Input Variables:
REQFILT - the filter holder number to rotate to.  The default is 256 which
does not exist on any of the filter holders.
                                                                                
Output Variables:
ERRFILT - if the filter is not found in 5 moves this variable is set to 1.
                                                                                
Subroutines Called:
FILTROT
                                                                                
Description:
FILTMOV rotates the filter wheel until the current filter (FILTVAL) equals
the requested value REQFILT.  The filter wheel will rotate a maximum
number of 5 positions before returning a ERRFILT=1 and stopping.
                                                                                
*******************************************************************

To us the routine FILTMOV the user must first set the variable REQFILT.
This variable is the number on the filter holder to rotate the filter wheel
to.  The default power-up value for REQFILT is given in the Galil Variables
document as 256.  Since there are only 255 possible filter numbers 
256 represents no filter requested.

It is assumed that user knows how to "send a command to the Galil"
and the directions for doing so are discussed elsewhere.

XQ is the Galil command to execute a routine.  So to set REQFILT to 5 and
then move to that position send the following commands to the Galil:

	REQFILT=5
	XQ #FILTMOV

These could be sent as two separate commands as above or as one command
separated by a semicolon:

	REQFILT=5;XQ #FILTMOV

After the move is complete one could check whether there was an error
in finding the filter, i.e. did the filter wheel move 5 positions
without finding the filter number?  Querying for the output variable, 
ERRFILT in this case, is done by sending the following to the Galil:

	MG ERRFILT

and then listening for the response.
